            <h2>Here's a timeline of Dahmer's terrible life:</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>May 21, 1960:</strong> Jeffrey Lionel Dahmer was born at Evangelical Deaconess Hospital in Milwaukee. According to Jeffrey's father, Lionel, his mother suffered bouts of partial paralysis during the pregnancy. Doctors were unable to find any reason for the paralysis. She was given "injections of barbiturates and morphine, which would finally relax her." Later she was given phenobarbital as well.</li>
                <br>
                <li><strong>1962:</strong> The Dahmers moved to Ames, Iowa, so Jeffrey's father could work on his Ph.D in chemistry.</li>
                <br>
                <li><strong>1964</strong>: Jeffrey was diagnosed with a double hernia in his scrotum. Surgery corrected it. Extreme pain suffered by the child both before and after the surgery could, conceivably, have influenced later feelings of sexual inadequacy or insecurity. Lionel claimed that it was from this time on that Jeffrey began to become more and more withdrawn and introverted.</li>
                <br>
                <li><strong>November 1966:</strong> The Dahmers moved to Doylestown, Ohio. There were several other moves over the next year as they searched for just the right place to bring up Jeffrey and his brother David, who was born on December 18.</li>
                <br>
                <li><strong>1968:</strong> The family moved to Bath, Ohio. It's likely he was diddled by a neighbor boy at this time, but this remains unproven.</li>
                <br>
                <li><strong>Late 1970:</strong> Jeffrey's mother was hospitalized twice for psychiatric problems. According to Lionel she had been taking drugs to deal with her extreme nervousness for years, but they didn't work well. Thus, she was not a stabilizing influence in Jeffrey's life.
                <br>
                <li><strong>June 4, 1978:</strong> Jeffrey graduated from high school. By this point he was living alone. His parents were going through an extremely bitter divorce and had each moved out. Because Jeffrey at 18, was legally an adult, the law did not allow for anyone to have custody of him. Therefore, no one took custody. Instability and a lack of emotional support continued.</li>
                <br>
                <li><strong>June 18, 1978:</strong> Dahmer picked up nineteen year old Steven Mark Hicks hitchhiking. They went back to the house for a few beers. When Hicks tried to leave, Dahmer clubbed him with a barbell and strangled him with it. Over the next couple of weeks he methodically stripped the flesh from the bones, smashed the bones and disposed of the few remains in the back yard.</li>
                <br>
                <li><strong>December 24, 1978:</strong> Lionel remarried.</li>
                <br>
                <li><strong>December 29, 1978:</strong> Jeffrey was sworn into the Army.
                <br>
                <li><strong>March 26, 1981:</strong> Dahmer was discharged from the Army before his enlistment was up because his drinking had reached the point where he simply didn't function any more. Back in the U.S., he went to Florida where he slept on the beach for a few months before returning to Ohio.</li>
                <br>
                <li><strong>October 7, 1981:</strong> Dahmer was arrested for disorderly conduct and resisting arrest and paid a small fine. He was drunk.</li>
                <br>
                <li><strong>August 7, 1982:</strong> Dahmer was arrested again for disorderly conduct. He dropped his pants in public. </li>
                <br>
                <li><strong>September 8, 1986:</strong> Jeffrey was arrested when he deliberately exposed himself while urinating in front of a group of children in Milwaukee.</li>
                <br>
                <li><strong>September 15, 1987 - June 1991:</strong> Dahmer drugged, murdered and canabalized a total of 17 men. Some were as young as 14</li>
                <br>
                <li><strong>January 14, 1992:</strong> Dahmer entered a plea of guilty but insane in 15 of the 17 murders he claimed to have committed.</li>
                <br>
                <li><strong>February 15, 1992:</strong> By 10-2 majority vote, a jury found Dahmer to be sane in each murder.</li>
                <br>
                <li><strong>February 17, 1992:</strong> Dahmer was sentenced to 15 consecutive life terms.</li>
                <br>
                <li><strong>November 28, 1994:</strong> Dahmer murdered in prison.</li>
